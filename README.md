#Trafic Light Priority Control For Emergency Vehicle

This Project Uses Peripherial interface controller to program a priority based traffic light controller for emergency vehicle.
Atmega328p microcontroller is used to program a priority based traffic light controller for emergency vehicle.
During emergency cases,emergency vehicles like ambulance can trigger the traffic light signal to change from red to green in order to make clerance for its path automatically.
Using RF,the traffic light operation will turn back to normal when the ambulance finishes crossing the road.
This project define how traffic signal lights will detect emergency vehicles, how to manipulate the traffic light and how to provide free way to emergency vehicle.
